                <p>
                    I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Maryland, specializing in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to address complex challenges in material science and drug discovery. With a strong foundation in Mechanical Engineering, holding a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, a Master's from Iowa State University, and an M.Tech from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, my research focuses on leveraging advanced computational techniques to drive innovation in materials design and optimization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My expertise includes developing and applying cutting-edge AI models, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Deep Reinforcement Learning, to accelerate the discovery and development of new materials. I am particularly passionate about creating interpretable and efficient AI solutions that can thrive in data-scarce environments, a common constraint in scientific research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my AI and ML expertise, I have extensive experience in developing physics-based models using COMSOL and Mathematica. I have successfully applied these tools to simulate complex phenomena, such as the mechanical degradation in lithium-ion batteries during my M.Tech research at IIT Madras. This multidisciplinary background allows me to seamlessly integrate physics-based principles with data-driven AI approaches, leading to more robust and insightful solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I have contributed to numerous high-impact publications in prestigious journals, including Nature Communications, Molecular Informatics, and the Journal of Applied Physics. My work has been recognized with several awards, including the Outstanding Graduate Assistant Award from the University of Maryland and the Engineering Data Analysis Software Quality Award from Caterpillar Virtual Products Division USA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am experienced in a wide range of programming languages and tools, including Python, MATLAB, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others, which I utilize to develop innovative solutions for real-world engineering problems. My current research endeavors aim to push the boundaries of AI in material science by exploring novel algorithms, enhancing model interpretability, and expanding the applicability of AI to multi-physics and high-rate problems.
